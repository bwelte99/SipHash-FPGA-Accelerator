# SipHash-FPGA-Accelerator
This repository contains the source code for an FPGA-based SipHash-x-y accelerator and an accompanying test bench (hardware and software).

The design can be instantiated in its test bench for either the Zedboard or ZCU106 using the .tcl scripts in the top-level directory.
