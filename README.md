# SipHash-FPGA-Accelerator
This repository contains the source code for an FPGA-based SipHash-x-y accelerator and an accompanying test bench (hardware and software).

The .tcl scripts included in this repository's top-level folder can be sourced in Vivado to instantiate the test bench on either the Zedboard or ZCU106.
